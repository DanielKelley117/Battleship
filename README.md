# Battleship
This is my final project for Intermediate Programming. It is Battleship. To play the game, run BattleShipDriver.java, and make sure that all of the above files are in the same directory to ensure proper compilation. No extra downloads are needed. All of the code featured in this project was written by me, except for Ship.java, and the enumerated types: ShipType.java, and CellStatus.java
